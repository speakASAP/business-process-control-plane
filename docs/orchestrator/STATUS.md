## Goal-driven lanes

| Lane | Owner | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Process registry and persistence | main orchestrator | complete for code validation | `npm run verify:process-registry` |
| Policy/workflow schema registry | sub-agent, integrated by main | complete for code validation | `npm run verify:policy-workflow` |
| Visual editor | sub-agent, integrated by main | complete for code validation | `npm run verify:editor` |
| Simulation scenarios | sub-agent, integrated by main | complete for code validation | `npm run verify:simulation` |
| Integration and validation | main orchestrator | complete for current non-deploy scope | `npm test`, runtime smoke |

- `npm run verify:process-registry`
- `npm run verify:policy-workflow`
- `npm run verify:editor`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run verify:simulation`
- `npm test`
- runtime smoke for `/health`, `/api/processes`, `/api/policies`, `/api/workflows`, `/api/simulate`, `/editor`
